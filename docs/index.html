            <h4> About Me</h4>
            <p> My name is Alisson Gossage, I am currently a freshman at Penn State Behrend and I am majoring in in the Digital Media, Arts, and
                Technology. Social media is the new world and everything about it interests me. </p>
            <p> Not quite sure what I want to come from this coding experience yet.</p>
        
       
        <h2>Reflective Essay</h2>
        The most significant challenges for a new learner is remembering what code is for what command.
        The advantage in the Penn State Site is that you dont have to code everything. If you write in 
        the text box they provide, they code the information for you. It's the opposite for Oxygen, you 
        write in code and it of course transforms it into text. Patience and time are neccesary to learn
        and develop both of these sites. I had more trouble and problems on GitHub since its more dynamic. If you
        enjoy coding, I would use oxygen and github, but if it's not your favorite, I would recommend psu sites.
        <br/>
        I want to learn all of the tools provided on Oxygen to improve my skills. 
        I need to memorize the coding used for specific things. I often have a hard time getting 
        it to do what I want it to. It looks really messy and overwhelming when you see all of the 
        code you have made, so it stressed me out at some points. Penn State Site has options in the 
        margin, you can change the appearance without having to code, make headings and add pictures. 
        You also have the option to view the coding in the text and how it is being made in the site. 
        In my opinion Penn State Site is better since you dont have to git pull anything to see the changes, 
        and you dont have to make a bunch of folders to store your data in. The one downside is you don't have
        as much freedom choosing an already set up theme, it puts things in places according to the layout
        you choose.
